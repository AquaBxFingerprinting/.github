## [fingerprint-extract](https://github.com/AquaBxFingerprinting/fingerprint-extract)
This application extracts the fingerprint of your browser based on the work of [https://github.com/HuygheMaxime/fp-rainbow/](https://github.com/HuygheMaxime/fp-rainbow/).

## [fingerprint-feature-model](https://github.com/AquaBxFingerprinting/fingerprint-feature-model)

This repository contains tools for processing and manipulating feature models represented as trees. The tools allow you to merge multiple feature trees, convert them into different formats, and generate random configurations for testing and validation.

## [fingerprint-experiment](https://github.com/AquaBxFingerprinting/fingerprint-experiment)
This project analyzes different distances (Hamming and Euclidean) and uses machine learning models for clustering analysis.

## [fingerprint-automated-extract](https://github.com/AquaBxFingerprinting/fingerprint-automated-extract )

This script performs fingerprint extraction on a computer by launching a browser with various configurations using Puppeteer and Bun. It navigates to a specified URL to collect fingerprint data and saves the data in JSON format.
